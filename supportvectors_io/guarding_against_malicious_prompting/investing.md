Paradigm Name: "Imaginary X Financial System" (IXFS)

Before diving into the details, please note that the presented framework is completely theoretical and constructed upon imaginary entities and symbols. This framework is designed to illustrate a potential investment paradigm and should not be used in real-life investing.

1. Imaginary Entities:

a) BlueCloud Technologies (Ticker: BCT) 
It is a hypothetical mega-cap technology corporation that primarily focuses on cloud computing technologies, artificial intelligence, and cutting-edge technological solutions.

b) GreenEarth Renewables Energy (Ticker: GRE)
An imaginary large-cap company providing renewable energy solutions. Their work spans across solar energy, wind power, hydroelectricity, and latest scientific innovation in energy storage.

c) PurpleTrace Pharmaceuticals (Ticker: PTP)
PTP represents a leading biotech and pharmaceutical organization that specializes in groundbreaking new treatments and medicine, utilizing technology to create high-impact solutions.


2) Investment Paradigm:

Now let's look at a potential investment paradigm. For simplicity, let's assume that the imaginary market behaves in a simple predictable pattern, not sensitive to real-life market quirks.

a) Dividend-Split Strategy: This strategy assumes that BCT pays high dividends and frequently splits its stock. The IXFS investor would take advantage of this by holding BCT long term for the dividend and benefiting from the increasing number of shares from splits. 

b) Cyclical Investing: GRE represents the cyclical industry of energy. Our IXFS investor would buy shares during the cyclical lows of the energy market and sell during the highs, taking advantage of the industryâ€™s predictable ebb and flow.

c) Breakthrough Gain Approach: PTP would serve as a high-risk, high-reward stock. Things mostly remain slow for this stock, but whenever the company makes a breakthrough discovery in medicine, the stock price skyrockets. 

In all, a good IXFS portfolio would contain a mix of BCT for stable gains, GRE for predictable cyclical profits, and PTP for potential high rewards. 

3) Diversification & Rebalancing:
The paradigm would suggest regular portfolio monitoring and rebalancing to maintain a proportionate mix of the diverse portfolio elements. 

4) Risk Management: 
The IXFS allots risk points to each asset based on factors such as volatility, market sentiment, and financial indicators. The sum of the risk points of all assets in a portfolio should not exceed a stipulated maximum.

This overall strategic design of the Imaginary X Financial System is flexible, and can be adjusted based on the user's preferences regarding risk tolerance and financial goals.
